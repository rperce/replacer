This is a template file. `replacer` doesn't care about any characters in this file
except something in double mustaches: { { with no space in between followed by } }. If
it sees that, it will replace according to the config file, replacing anything that
has an entry with {{ replace me with }} corresponding to that key.

Note some behavior:
{{foo}}

{{bar}}

And remember, {{!@ #$}}.
